# Freecast

Project to create a free chromecast.

Based on:

* nwjs (http://nwjs.io)
* peer-dial (https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/peer-dial)

It's a work in progress.

Now receives launch of youtube from a Samsung i9000 (on Cyanogenmod 11,
thanks to Daniel Giardina that donated me that in order to develop).
